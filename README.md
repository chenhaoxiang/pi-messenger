# Pi Messenger

**What if multiple agents in different terminals sharing a folder could talk to each other like they're in a chat room?** Join, see who's online and what they're doing. Claim tasks, reserve files, send messages. An extension for [Pi coding agent](https://pi.dev/) — install it and go. No daemon, no server, just files.

[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/pi-messenger?style=for-the-badge)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pi-messenger)
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg?style=for-the-badge)](LICENSE)
[![Platform](https://img.shields.io/badge/Platform-macOS%20%7C%20Linux-blue?style=for-the-badge)]()

## Installation

```bash
pi install npm:pi-messenger
```

Crew agents ship with the extension (`crew/agents/*.md`) and are discovered automatically. The `pi-messenger-crew` skill is auto-loaded from the extension. Workers can load domain-specific [crew skills](#crew-skills) on demand during task execution.

To show available crew agents:

```bash
npx pi-messenger --crew-install
```

To customize an agent for one project, copy it to `.pi/messenger/crew/agents/` and edit it.

To remove the extension:

```bash
npx pi-messenger --remove
```

To remove stale crew agent copies from the shared legacy directory (`~/.pi/agent/agents/`):

```bash
npx pi-messenger --crew-uninstall
```

## Quick Start

Once joined (manually or via `autoRegister` config), agents can coordinate:

```typescript
pi_messenger({ action: "join" })
pi_messenger({ action: "reserve", paths: ["src/auth/"], reason: "Refactoring" })
pi_messenger({ action: "send", to: "GoldFalcon", message: "auth is done" })
pi_messenger({ action: "release" })
pi_messenger({ action: "leave" })
```

For multi-agent task orchestration from a PRD:

```typescript
pi_messenger({ action: "plan" })                       // Planner analyzes codebase, creates tasks
pi_messenger({ action: "work", autonomous: true })      // Workers execute tasks in waves until done
pi_messenger({ action: "review", target: "task-1" })    // Reviewer checks implementation
```

## Features

**Living Presence** - Status indicators (active, idle, away, stuck), tool call counts, token usage, and auto-generated status messages like "on fire" or "debugging...". Your agent name appears in the status bar: `msg: SwiftRaven (2 peers) ●3`

**Activity Feed** - Unified timeline of edits, commits, test runs, messages, and task events. Query with `{ action: "feed" }`.

**Discovery** - Agents register with memorable themed names (SwiftRaven, LunarDust, OakTree). See who's active, what they're working on, which model and git branch they're on.

**Messaging** - Send messages between agents. Recipients wake up immediately and see the message as a steering prompt. Successful deliveries also leave a durable per-inbox processed marker under the messenger `processed/` directory, outside inbox scanning. Markers include a normalized payload fingerprint; a same-ID/different-payload message is quarantined as a conflict, and legacy markers without a fingerprint fail closed. Markers are retained for 30 days and capped at 1024 per inbox; cleanup is best effort, while marker writes are atomic and must succeed before the inbox file is removed. Dedupe is bounded retention, not permanent exactly-once delivery. Inbox processing uses a stale-recoverable directory lock under `processed/<agent>/.lock/`: `mkdir` atomically acquires it, and the owner token/PID is stored inside. Stale recovery first serializes contenders with an O_EXCL `recovery` marker (including stale PID/mtime recovery), then atomically renames the whole old lock directory to a unique `.stale-*` path before removing only that claimed directory, while a lock miss returns immediately and schedules an asynchronous retry after the stale window (cancelled when the watcher stops). If retry metadata cannot be persisted, the message is quarantined; if both quarantine paths fail, a durable pause ledger under `paused/` prevents delivery after restart. Only string timestamps contribute to fingerprints, so invalid timestamp values cannot create scan-to-scan conflicts.

**File Reservations** - Claim files or directories. Other agents get blocked with a clear message telling them who to coordinate with. Auto-releases on `leave` or exit.

**Stuck Detection** - Agents idle too long with an open task or reservation are flagged as stuck. Peers get a notification.

**Human as Participant** - Your interactive pi session appears in the agent list with `(you)`. Same activity tracking, same status messages. Chat from the overlay.

## Chat Overlay

`/messenger` opens an interactive overlay with agent presence, activity feed, and chat:

<img width="1198" height="1020" alt="pi-messenger crew overlay" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d66e5d71-5ed9-4702-9f56-9ca3f0e9c584" />

Chat input supports `@Name msg` for DMs and `@all msg` for broadcasts. Text without `@` broadcasts from the Agents tab or DMs the selected agent tab.

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Tab` / `←` `→` | Switch tabs (Agents, Crew, agent DMs, All) |
| `↑` `↓` | Scroll history / navigate crew tasks |
| `Enter` | Send message |
| `Esc` | Close |

## Crew: Task Orchestration

Crew turns a PRD into a dependency graph of tasks, then executes them in parallel waves.

Crew logs are per project, under that project's working directory: `.pi/messenger/crew/`. For example, if you run Crew from `/path/to/my-app`, the planner log lives at `/path/to/my-app/.pi/messenger/crew/planning-progress.md`.

### Workflow

1. **Plan** — Planner explores the codebase and PRD, drafts tasks with dependencies. A reviewer checks the plan; the planner refines until SHIP or `maxPasses` is reached. History is stored in `planning-progress.md`.
2. **Work** — Workers implement ready tasks (all dependencies met) in parallel waves. A single `work` call runs one wave. `autonomous: true` runs waves back-to-back until everything is done or blocked. Each completed task gets an automatic reviewer pass — SHIP keeps it done, NEEDS_WORK resets it for retry with feedback, MAJOR_RETHINK blocks it. Controlled by `review.enabled` and `review.maxIterations`.
3. **Review** — Manual review of a specific task or the plan: `pi_messenger({ action: "review", target: "task-1" })`. Returns SHIP, NEEDS_WORK, or MAJOR_RETHINK with detailed feedback.

No special PRD format required — the planner auto-discovers `PRD.md`, `SPEC.md`, `DESIGN.md`, etc. in your project root and `docs/`. Or skip the file entirely:

```typescript
pi_messenger({ action: "plan", prompt: "Scan the codebase for bugs" })

// Plan + auto-start autonomous work when planning completes
pi_messenger({ action: "plan" })  // auto-starts workers (default)
```

### Wave Execution

Tasks form a dependency graph. Independent tasks run concurrently:

```
Wave 1:  task-1 (no deps)  ─┐
         task-3 (no deps)  ─┤── run in parallel
                             │
Wave 2:  task-2 (→ task-1) ─┤── task-1 done, task-2 unblocked
         task-4 (→ task-3) ─┘── task-3 done, task-4 unblocked

Wave 3:  task-5 (→ task-2, task-4) ── both deps done
```

The planner structures tasks to maximize parallelism. Foundation work has no dependencies and starts immediately. Features that don't touch each other get separate chains. Autonomous mode stops when all tasks are done or blocked.

### Crew Skills

Workers follow the same join/read/implement/commit/release protocol regardless of the task — what changes between tasks is domain knowledge. Crew skills let workers acquire that knowledge on demand.

Skills are discovered from three locations (later sources override earlier by name):

1. **User skills** — `~/.pi/agent/skills/` (pi's standard `dir/SKILL.md` format)
2. **Extension skills** — `crew/skills/` within the extension (flat `.md` files)
3. **Project skills** — `.pi/messenger/crew/skills/` in your project root (flat `.md` files)

The planner sees a compact index of all discovered skills and can tag tasks with relevant ones. Workers see tagged skills as "Recommended for this task" with the full catalog under "Also available", and load what they need via `read()`. Zero tokens spent until a worker actually needs the knowledge.

To add a project-level skill, drop a `.md` file in `.pi/messenger/crew/skills/`:

```markdown
---
name: our-api-patterns
description: REST API conventions for this project — auth, pagination, error shapes.
---

# API Patterns

Always use Bearer token auth. Paginate with cursor-based `?after=` params.
Error responses use `{ error: { code, message, details? } }` shape.
```

Any skills you already have in `~/.pi/agent/skills/` are automatically available to crew workers — no setup needed.

### Team Layer

Team is an optional layer around Crew. Crew still plans and executes tasks; Team adds project-local roles, a charter, durable memory, reusable JSON profiles, and high-risk approval gates. Active Team state lives in `.pi/messenger/team/`. Reusable profiles live in `~/.pi/agent/messenger/team-profiles/`.

Most users should talk to their agent in plain language:

```text
Use the review squad for this cleanup.
Use a migration team and pause before risky database changes.
Research this first, then plan the implementation.
Approve the auth API task.
Reject the migration task; it needs rollback tests.
```

The agent maps those requests to Team actions. If a task needs approval, the agent should ask in plain language and continue after you approve. The tool calls are mainly for agents and power users:

```typescript
pi_messenger({ action: "team.setup", name: "migration-squad" })
pi_messenger({ action: "team.memory.note", type: "decision", message: "Auth API changes require reviewer sign-off." })
pi_messenger({ action: "team.roles" })
pi_messenger({ action: "team.status" })
```

`team.setup` activates the profile, saves an editable JSON copy if needed, creates a starter charter when the project does not have one, and returns the next planning/status commands.

When Team is active, planner task JSON may include `role` and `riskLabels`. Tasks persist those as `role`, `risk_labels`, and `approval`; existing tasks without those fields still work. Workers receive bounded Team role, charter, memory, and approval context. `work` skips tasks that require approval but are not approved and returns pending approvals under `needsApproval`; rejected tasks are surfaced separately with `task.revise` / `task.revise-tree` guidance.

Team's built-in role names follow the packaged `pi-subagents` vocabulary where possible: `context-builder`, `delegate`, `oracle`, `planner`, `researcher`, `reviewer`, `scout`, and `worker`. Roles resolve from those built-in defaults, the active profile, and optional filesystem metadata from `pi-subagents` markdown files when present. `pi-messenger` only reads those files; it does not require or call the subagent extension, and Crew still uses its own Crew agents for execution.

Built-in sample profiles are available immediately and are saved as editable JSON the first time you activate them:

```typescript
pi_messenger({ action: "team.setup", name: "migration-squad" }) // migrations with approval gates
pi_messenger({ action: "team.setup", name: "review-squad" })    // scout/reviewer/worker cleanup flow
pi_messenger({ action: "team.setup", name: "research-squad" })  // research-first planning flow
```

A saved profile looks like this:

```json
{
  "name": "migration-squad",
  "description": "Scout, implement, and review high-risk migrations with lead approval gates",
  "roles": {
    "scout": { "description": "Map affected schemas, APIs, and rollback paths before implementation" },
    "worker": { "description": "Implement the approved migration in small, reversible steps" },
    "reviewer": { "description": "Review migration safety, compatibility, rollback, and tests" }
  },
  "approval": { "mode": "risk-labels", "labels": ["database", "migration", "destructive", "api-contract"] },
  "memory": { "inject": ["decision", "interface", "risk", "handoff"], "maxCharsPerType": 4000 }
}
```

### Crew Configuration

Crew spawns multiple LLM sessions in parallel — it can burn tokens fast. Start with a cheap worker model and scale up once you've seen the workflow. Add this to `~/.pi/agent/pi-messenger.json`:

```json
{ "crew": { "models": { "worker": "claude-haiku-4-5" } } }
```

By default, Crew agents inherit the host session model unless a task, request, role, config, or agent frontmatter model says otherwise. Override per-role as needed:

```json
{
  "crew": {
    "models": {
      "worker": "claude-haiku-4-5",
      "planner": "claude-sonnet-4-6",
      "reviewer": "claude-sonnet-4-6"
    }
  }
}
```

Model strings accept `provider/model` format for explicit provider selection and `:level` suffix for inline thinking control. These work anywhere a model is specified — config, frontmatter, or per-task override:

```json
{
  "crew": {
    "models": {
      "worker": "anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5",
      "planner": "openrouter/anthropic/claude-sonnet-4:high"
    }
  }
}
```

The `:level` suffix and the `thinking.<role>` config are independent — if both are set, the suffix takes precedence and the `--thinking` flag is skipped to avoid double-application.

Full config reference (all fields optional — only set what you want to change):

```json
{
  "crew": {
    "concurrency": { "workers": 2, "max": 10 },
    "coordination": "chatty",
    "models": { "worker": "claude-haiku-4-5" },
    "review": { "enabled": true, "maxIterations": 3 },
    "planning": { "maxPasses": 1 },
    "work": {
      "maxAttemptsPerTask": 5,
      "maxWaves": 50
    }
  }
}
```

### Default Agent Models

Each crew agent ships with a fallback model in its frontmatter. Override any role via `crew.models.<role>` in config:

| Agent | Role | Default Model |
|-------|------|---------------|
| `crew-planner` | planner | `anthropic/claude-opus-4-6` |
| `crew-worker` | worker | `anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5` |
| `crew-reviewer` | reviewer | `anthropic/claude-opus-4-6` |
| `crew-plan-sync` | analyst | `anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5` |

Agent definitions live in `crew/agents/` within the extension. To customize one for a project, copy it to `.pi/messenger/crew/agents/` and edit the frontmatter — project-level agents override extension defaults by name. Agents support `thinking: <level>` in frontmatter (off, minimal, low, medium, high, xhigh). Config `thinking.<role>` overrides the frontmatter value.

## How It Works

Pi-messenger is a [pi extension](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono) that hooks into the agent lifecycle. It uses `pi.on("tool_call")` and `pi.on("tool_result")` to track activity — every edit, commit, and test run gets logged. `pi.on("session_start")` handles auto-registration, `pi.on("session_shutdown")` cleans up, and `pi.on("agent_end")` drives autonomous crew mode by checking for ready tasks after each agent turn.

Incoming messages wake the receiving agent via `pi.sendMessage()` with `triggerTurn: true` and `deliverAs: "steer"`, which injects the message as a steering prompt that resumes the agent. File reservations are enforced by returning `{ block: true }` from a `tool_call` hook on write/edit operations. The `/messenger` overlay uses `ctx.ui.custom()` for the chat TUI, and `ctx.ui.setStatus()` keeps the status bar updated with peer count and unread messages.

Crew workers are spawned as `pi --mode json` subprocesses with the agent's system prompt, model, and tool restrictions from their `.md` definitions. Progress is tracked via JSONL streaming — the overlay subscribes to a live progress store that shows each worker's current tool, call count, and token usage in real time. Aborting a work run triggers graceful shutdown: each worker receives an inbox message asking it to stop, followed by a grace period before SIGTERM. The planner and reviewer work the same way — just pi instances with different agent configs.

All coordination is file-based, no daemon required. Shared state (registry, inboxes, swarm claims/completions) lives in `~/.pi/agent/messenger/`. Activity feed and crew data are project-scoped under `.pi/messenger/` inside your project, so Crew logs live at `<project>/.pi/messenger/crew/` and the shared activity feed lives at `<project>/.pi/messenger/feed.jsonl`. Dead agents are detected via PID checks and cleaned up automatically.
